# Predict-Diabetes-with-Machine-Learning

According to the report of Centers of Disease Control and Prevention about one in seven adults in the United States have Diabetes. But by next few years this rate can move higher. With this in mind, How you can use machine learning to Predict Diabetes using Python.

# About dataset:

The data was collected and made available by “National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here belong to the Pima Indian heritage (subgroup of Native Americans), and are females of ages 21 and above.

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)

# Related packages:

using Python and some of its popular data science related packages. First of all, we will import pandas to read our data from a CSV file and manipulate it for further use. We will also use numpy to convert out data into a format suitable to feed our classification model. We’ll use seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations. We will then import Logistic Regression algorithm from sklearn. 


# Using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm in this Project:
The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is arguably the simplest machine learning algorithm. Building the model consists only of storing the training data set. To make a prediction for a new point in the dataset, the algorithm finds the closest data points in the training data set — its “nearest neighbors.”

The k-means algorithm searches for a pre-determined number of clusters within an unlabeled multidimensional dataset.

# Decision Tree :

Decision tree is a basic classification method. It is supervised learning method. Decision tree used when response variable is categorical. Decision tree has tree like structure based model which describes classi- fication process based on input feature. Input variables are any types like graph, text, discrete, continuous etc.
