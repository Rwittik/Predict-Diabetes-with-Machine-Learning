# Predict-Diabetes-with-Machine-Learning

According to the report of Centers of Disease Control and Prevention about one in seven adults in the United States have Diabetes. But by next few years this rate can move higher. With this in mind, How you can use machine learning to Predict Diabetes using Python.


#Using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm in this Project
The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is arguably the simplest machine learning algorithm. Building the model consists only of storing the training data set. To make a prediction for a new point in the dataset, the algorithm finds the closest data points in the training data set — its “nearest neighbors.”

The k-means algorithm searches for a pre-determined number of clusters within an unlabeled multidimensional dataset.
